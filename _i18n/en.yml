  title: I am not a developer, what is CodeGlass?
  description: >  
    Picture an MRI scanner, an invaluable tool for doctors and patients. Now, visualize having a similar breakthrough technology in the realm of software development. That's CodeGlass. <br/>
    <br/>
    Just as an MRI allows doctors to peer inside a patient non-invasively, CodeGlass enables you to delve into the inner workings of a running application. It does this in real time, without needing access to or altering the source code. This innovation is a game changer. People may appear similar internally, but every application is distinct, even average mobile apps comprise over a thousand pages of code. This complexity can mean weeks of orientation for new developers. CodeGlass dramatically simplifies this process.
    <br/><br/>
    Additionally, just as doctors use MRI scans to diagnose issues within the human body, CodeGlass offers similar diagnostic capabilities for software. It doesn't just show you where and what the problem is; it also explains why and how it occurred, making any bug replicable and easier to understand.
    <br/><br/>
    Consider a software bug akin to a 911 call reporting a traffic accident. The bug's call stack is the initial report, leaving developers to unravel the cause to prevent future occurrences. This detective work can take days. With CodeGlass, however, this process is condensed into mere minutes, streamlining problem-solving and enhancing productivity in software development.

#############  Solution  ############
#####################################
solution-title: The Solution
solution-description: > 
  This is why CodeGlass is the next generation development tool, and much more than just a profiler and, above all, the only one of its kind. You can find more reasons on our collaborative GitHub pages, we kept it at 9 as it looked nice.<br/>Currently, 
  we support <strong>.NET</strong> applications and <strong>JavaScript</strong>* websites, but we are constantly working on supporting more runtimes as the solution is language-agnostic, with <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>NodeJS</strong> coming soon. <br/>
  <br/>
  * Experimental feature, as such, it is an Experimental Edition feature only for now.

solutions:
  - title: Realtime Code Profiler
    description: CodeGlass is the only real-time Code profiler in existence that collects every call and giving you direct access to the data without recording it first. Its not sampling. With additional control like stepping, throttling, rendering, advanced filtering, code body reconstruction and more.<br/><br/>
    icon: icofont-ui-timer

  - title: Maintenance Tool
    description: CodeGlass gives you direct insight into how your application works by realtime rendering every step the application takes. Gone are the times you had to stuggle to understands someone elses project, code you have not worked on for years or Lady and the Tramp its dinner.<br/><br/>
    icon: icofont-chart-pie-alt

  - title: Diagnostic Tool
    description: Have the means to diagnose and fix any problem. For Example, create a snapshot and compare why it did not work this time or why it worked on your pc but not on theirs. Pause the execution and step back and see what led to the exception and if other threads are involved, and identify racing conditions.<br/><br/>
    icon: icofont-tools

  - title: Execution Control
    description: CodeGlass gives you basic control like start, pause, stop and restart. But it also has advanced methods like Stepping forwards and backwards, throttling and a profiler standby mode that gives you near the full performance of your application and allow you to start profiling again when you need it.<br/><br/><br/>
    icon: icofont-ui-next
    
  - title: It is fast
    description: CodeGlass can collect and process over 8.000.000 unfiltered function calls per second. It depends on usage and your hardware, of course, but you do not have to notice any slowdown in your application by setting the correct filters. In most cases, CodeGlass can give you quicker the results you need than others.<br/><br/>
    icon: icofont-airplane-alt

  - title: Remote
    description: Connect to other CodeGlass instances and use CodeGlass remotely. Like running it on a production server and just connecting your development machine to it. Or helping a college and not having to sit on his lap.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
    icon: icofont-cloud

  - title: Advanced filtering
    description: CodeGlass makes it intuitive and straightforward to filter on the things you want to profile so you can focus on the data that matters. You can even make regex rules or only not filter public functions.
    icon: icofont-filter

  - title: Code Body Statistics
    description: CodeGlass goes beyond other profilers, analyses the collected data, and tries to reconstruct a functions code body to give you more in-depth data, like showing where threads are in a function or how many times a loop is executed. But also where time is spent, eliminating the need to add stopwatches to your code.
    icon: icofont-chart-bar-graph

  - title: No Source code
    description: CodeGlass does everything without needing the source code of the application. Just give him a supported application, and it will do its thing. You can even profile PowerShell with it if you want to.

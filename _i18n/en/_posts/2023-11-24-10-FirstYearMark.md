ðŸŽ‰ Exciting Milestones and a Year of Growth! ðŸš€

Today marks the exact day when it all began! What a fantastic journey it has been for CodeGlass! ðŸ™Œ

In 2022, we started with an incredible opportunity by being chosen to participate in IMEC, where we later emerged as one of the startups to receive mentorship and support. This marked the beginning of our incredible journey.

Over the course of this year, we've grown from strength to strength, expanding our team to a remarkable 6 members, and there are more incredible talents to come on board.

We've had the privilege of attending unique events, making connections, and even embarking on a memorable trip to London, soaking in inspiration from all corners of the world.

But that's not all! ðŸŒŸ CodeGlass was chosen as one of the next icons of 2023, and we couldn't be prouder!

This year has been a true learning curve, filled with intense discussions, long days, and late nights of hard work. We welcomed our first customers and established invaluable partnerships.

And guess what? The excitement continues! In just a few days, we'll be heading to Slush, and in a couple of months, our journey to CES will kick off. The future is bright, and there's so much more to come.

As we look back with pride on this incredible year, we're filled with hope and determination for the many more years of innovation, success, and growth that lie ahead. ðŸŒ 

Thank you for being part of our journey. We can't wait to see what the future holds!

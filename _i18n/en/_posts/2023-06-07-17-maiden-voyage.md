We are thrilled to announce the highly anticipated launch of CodeGlass v1.2.1 as it sets sail on its maiden voyage! 
With an extensive five-year development period that involved private betas, rigorous testing, and invaluable validation, the moment of unveiling has finally arrived.

Someone among us jokingly suggested celebrating this milestone by breaking a bottle of champagne over the build server to symbolise a true maiden voyage. We all shared a laugh; however, we decided against it as our developer hearts could not take such abuse and enjoyed it ourselves.

We've been fortunate to be surrounded by early adopters and loyal customers who played an integral role in bringing CodeGlass to market. In anticipation of London Tech Week next week, we decided to reveal CodeGlass in advance, ensuring it would be ready and available.

With heartfelt dedication, we have poured our passion and expertise into creating an exceptional product. We sincerely hope that you, the developers and software enthusiasts, will embrace CodeGlass with the same enthusiasm and admiration that our early customers have expressed.

As CodeGlass embarks on its maiden voyage into the hands of developers worldwide, we eagerly await the revolution it will make for them, as it did for our early adopters. 

We are immensely grateful for the unwavering support of our early adopters, and we invite all of you to be part of our growing community. 
Join us and experience first hand the remarkable capabilities of CodeGlass shaping the future of coding.

Kind regards, <br/>
Tyrone Krieger, <br/>
Lynn Weggemans, <br/>
Terence Bremmer, <br/>
Lizard Doggo, <br/>
And the rest of the team behind CodeGlass.
